The goal of this phase was to be able to build a Single Page Application (SPA) utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  The SPA must communicate with a backend API built with Ruby and Rails. It was quite an abrupt change from Ruby & Rails to Javascript, but was able to find similar principles. The idea of building objects and utilizing classes. 

In javascript constructor are like "initialize" in ruby. When a new object of that class is created it uses the constructor to build the object. In my application, I used it to build Projects, Project Types, and Stories. 

One of the most important features of ES6 are let and const statements. They both can be used to define a variable. Prior to these two statements users were only able to use "var". It seems var is not really recommended to use anymore as let and const accomplish both needs. "let" allows users to set a variable that can be redeclared at anytime. "const" is not able to be redeclared at all. 

Arrow functions do not have their own this, and cannot be used as a constructor. All arrow functions are anonymous, meaning they do not have a name.

These are just some of the unique feature of Javascript that I found so critical while build my application. Then taking this application and marrying it with the rails API was another part I found interesting. Although, I had the ability to edit my API to send me the data I want, I know when working with third-party api's we won't have that ability. I think that thought alone, helped me to realize how important a good API and documentation is to users. 

All in all, I found this project really educational, and informative. I often was pushing myself beyond my comfort zone and trying multiple things. I was use debugger when things weren't broken, just to verify the data that was being sent, and the ways I could utilize javescript.

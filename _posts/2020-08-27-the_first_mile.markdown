First, let me introduce myself. My name is Phillip Smith and I am a product expert for a software company. I have decided to further my knowledge and experience by learning the coding side of product development. I have experience in simple html, css, and python but looking to improve my knowledge greatly. 

One might ask how the setting up and process has gone. Overall pretty simple to get started. Feel a little lost in this First mile stage, as I seem to get some conflicting information. I hope all that will be cleared up with classes starting in about a week. Once we have the change to formaly kick things off, I am sure I will have a better grasp of what is expected. 

I'll keep this short this time, and sum all this up by letting you all know, it's pretty simply to get going.
